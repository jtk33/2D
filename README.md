Welcome to the best game ever!!! (Note: there is insufficient proof to back this claim)

The controls are as follows:

WASD for directional movement.
E to open the skill tree.
Space to interact or select.
ESC to shut off the game.

Interacting with the stray items will equip them.
Interacting with the trolls will initiate a battle.

Each piece of gear is currently purely aesthetic, but they do make the happy guy look very nice.
